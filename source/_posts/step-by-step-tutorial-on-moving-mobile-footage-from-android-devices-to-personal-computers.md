### What is Markdown file?

Basically, this method is used to easily read and write plain text and at the same time, it is a conversion tool. Markdown has two things, a plain text formatting syntax and a software tool that allows you to convert your plain text into XHTML or HTML. It is also the unofficial standard on some popular coding sites and other software development platforms. It is one of the essential parts that programmers, web writers, and developers should know and must learn.

Converting Markdown to PDF files is a great way to bring your Markdown files like documents or if you want a different output method other than HTML. In this case, listed below are tools you can use to convert your Markdown files to PDF.
