## What is “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT”?

PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT is a fake pop-up warning message sent by cyberattackers claiming to be from Microsoft. Such fraudulent warnings are intended to frighten users and deceive them into calling a fake technical support number, install a phony virus remover, and a one-time for the technical service provided. This is what the message says:

> _PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT_
> 
> _This computer has been LOCKED._
> 
> _Do not close this window or restart your computer without calling support._
> 
> _We have locked this computer for your security._
> 
> _You have been browsing unsafe pornographic websites._
> 
> _Your computer has been infected._
> 
> _Contact the Microsoft helpline to reactivate your computer._
> 
> _Failure to call will result in a notice being sent to your residence._

When this pop-up appears on the browser screen, users are redirected to a phony page of Microsoft that contains a fake helpline number. After seeing such a message, many users get frightened and follow the instructions of the pop-up, i.e., call the given fake helpline number of Microsoft. On reaching the given number, the cyber attacker pretending to be a technician would ask the caller to download and install a fake antivirus program, which is, in reality, a malicious program that can be anything like Trojan, Spyware, Ransomware, Adware, or others.

There could be various reasons users might get such fake alerts in the form of pop-ups.

## Why did I get the “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT” Pop-Up?

If you see the “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT” pop-up message on your screen, it might be because of one of the following reasons:

* You might have visited an infected website while looking for freeware or similar things on the internet.
* Your system might be infected with an Adware program, which is causing the irrelevant ads and pop-ups on your browsing screen.
* The browser you are using might be tainted with ill-disposed malware known as Browser Hijacker. A browser hijacker can take control of your browser’s settings and redirect you to infected sites.
* Many users blindly install the software programs without unchecking the bundled programs that come with the installer. Cybercriminals often introduce malware such as Adware and trojans through the bundled programs.

If you are dealing with this message or pop-up repeatedly, you have to get rid of the root cause redirecting this fake message to you.

Here are the steps for that:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**
