For instance, you might have to search Australia or any other place just for some news or general knowledge. The next thing you will notice is that you are getting ads from tourism websites offering you a trip to Australia with different travel packages. The ads will be continuously displayed on every ad-supported website you visit. This ad bombardment is caused by the ad trackers installed on the browsers and your device. Such ads can be pretty frustrating, especially while you are browsing something urgently related to your work. You might accidentally click on any [such ads](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), get redirected to unintended websites, and disturb your workflow.

If you don’t want such annoyance on your device, there are several ways to disable the ad tracking on your device.

## What is Ad Tracking?

Ad tracking is the practice used by advertisers to track online behavior and browsing preferences of the users to target them with filtered or relevant advertisements. The advertising agencies use web elements such as cookies, web trackers, and browser fingerprinters for tracking you. Through ad tracking, the advertisers can gain the following information: **Age, Gender, Preference, Ethnicity, Likes & Dislikes**, and more. Cybercriminals can also use ad trackers to the system with [malicious ads](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Even though ad tracking is a concern for your privacy, it is not always bad. However, that depends totally on your thinking. Whatever you do, the advertisers are not going to stop displaying the ads. So, if you are getting advertisements based on your interests, it is better than the irrelevant or offensive ads popping up on your screen. Ad tracking might also help you in grabbing the best deal on the products you want to buy.

## How to disable the Ad Tracker on Windows?

Windows use ad trackers to display advertisement of paid software to Windows OS users. You might have noticed the ads on the Start menu, the Cortana app, or the Action Center. To turn them off, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Windows Settings**
2. Click on **Privacy**.  
![Privacy settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Privacy-settings.png)
3. Under the **General** tab, switch off all the buttons if you are privacy concerned.![change Windows 10 privacy settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/change-Windows-10-pricacy-settings.png)

1. Go to **Windows Settings**
2. Choose **Personalization** ![Personalization settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Personalization-settings.png)
