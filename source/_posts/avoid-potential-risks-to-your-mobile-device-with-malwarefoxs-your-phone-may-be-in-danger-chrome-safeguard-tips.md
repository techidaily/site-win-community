## Why Phone May Be in Danger Notification on Chrome?

Let’s be clear, you haven’t done anything wrong. You may have unwittingly given permission to a website to send you notifications. This could be after you’ve clicked an “Allow” button to download a file or watch a video, or even answered a seemingly harmless question such as “Are you above the age of 18?” 

These rogue websites use notifications to grab your attention, often scaring you with fake warnings. The moment you click on them, you’re directed to infected websites or tricked into downloading malicious files or apps.

## FAQs

**Can Google Detect Virus?** 

Google’s cybersecurity technologies are good, but they are not as good as antivirus solutions in finding malware.

**Why does it say my phone is in danger?** 

Your phone is not really in Danger. Your browser might have been compromised, or you might have unknowingly agreed to get such dubious notifications from a harmful website.

**Is the virus warning on my phone real?** 

Virus warning from a realtime Antivirus program on your device is real. Apart from that, any notification about virus detection is fake.
